    question: "How does Kyro work?",
    answer:
      "Kyro connects you with gyms worldwide through our app. Simply browse available gyms in your destination, choose a pass duration (day, week, or month), and purchase directly through the app. Show your digital pass at the gym and you're ready to train!",
  },
  {
    question: "What types of passes are available?",
    answer:
      "We offer flexible pass options to suit any travel schedule: Day passes for quick workouts, Week passes for short trips, and Month passes for extended stays. Each pass gives you full access to the gym's facilities during your selected period.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which gyms are part of the Kyro network?",
    answer:
      "We're partnering with quality gyms in major cities and travel destinations worldwide. Our network includes everything from boutique fitness studios to fully-equipped commercial gyms. The full list will be available when we launch!",
  },
  {
    question: "How much do gym passes cost?",
    answer:
      "Pass prices vary by gym and location, but are always significantly cheaper than traditional memberships for short-term access. Day passes typically start from $10-25, with better value for longer durations. No hidden fees, no contracts.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my payment secure?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. We use industry-standard encryption and secure payment processing. Your payment information is never stored on our servers, and all transactions are protected.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel or get a refund?",
    answer:
      "Unused passes can be refunded up to 24 hours before the start date. If a gym is unexpectedly closed during your pass period, we'll extend your pass or provide a full refund. Your satisfaction is our priority.",
  },
  {
    question: "When will Kyro launch?",
    answer:
      "We're working hard to launch soon! Join our waitlist to be the first to know when we go live and get exclusive early access benefits.",
